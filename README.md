## Lets Intro BlockChain to You

 [A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/elangosundar/awesome-README-templates)


## Adding a Plot twist
Running blockchain on custom made TERMINAL 
### some basic functions present in terminal
```bash
void read();
void write();
void append();
void clear();
void help();
void dt();
void exits();
void startscreen();
void removes();
void renames();
void edit();
void cdir();
void copy();
void cknow();
void lknow();
void ccount();
void gcd();
void lcm();
void tconv();
```

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GURSEWAK13/UCA-c-project.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd UCA-c-project
```

To run terminal

```bash
  make Wakanda Forever
```
To Build it from scratch
```bash
  make Build from scratch
```

To run blockchain 

```bash
  LetsRock
```
